10 print "This is a simple ABL program"
20 input n
22 if n = 42 then print "back to the start": goto 20
25 i=sqr(sqr(n))

All lines are stripped of whitespace characters. What follows determines if it's common or code.
One consequence of this is that code can be indented for effect:
30 j=(i^2)^2

Code begins with a number followed by a statement or variable.

35printn,j

Everything else is a comment.

39. Including this (Note the period '.' following the number).

40 goto 20

This should allow most if not all markdown syntax to be valid comments
which would make for fun documentation.
