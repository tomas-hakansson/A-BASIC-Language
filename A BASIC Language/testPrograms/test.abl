This is a simple ABL program
20 input n
25 i=sqr(sqr(n))

All lines are stripped of whitespace characters. What follows determines if it's common or code.
One consequence of this is that code can be indented for effect:
    30 j=(i^2)^2

Code begins with a number followed by a statement or variable.

35printn

Everything else is a comment.

38 print j

39. Including this (Note the period '.' following the number).

40 goto 20

This should allow most if not all markdown syntax to be valid comments
    which would make for fun documentation.
