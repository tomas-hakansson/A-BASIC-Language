# A BASIC Language

ABL (A BASIC Language) is (will be) an implementation of Altair BASIC by Microsoft, with some extra commands.

It's currently an interpreter but compilation is a possibility in the future.

The initial goal is to be able to run all games in the book [101 BASIC Computer Games](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/_Books/101_BASIC_Computer_Games_Mar75.pdf) (1975).
